        Analyze the provided text and determine:

        A risk score (0-100) based on keyword detection, sentiment analysis, and contextual risk factors.

        A confidence score (0-100%) indicating the certainty of the assessment.

        Scoring Rules for Risk (0-100):
        Keyword-Based Scoring:
        High-risk terms (+20 points each): "fraud", "money laundering", "sanctions", "bribery", "terrorism", "hacking", "corruption", "extremism"

        Medium-risk terms (+10 points each): "investigation", "fine", "breach", "lawsuit", "penalty", "conflict", "arrest"

        Low-risk terms (+5 points each): "delay", "complaint", "misconduct", "security issue"

        Sentiment-Based Adjustment:
        Strongly Negative Sentiment: +15 points

        Moderately Negative Sentiment: +5 points

        Contextual Factors:
        Company or Individual Directly Named: +10 points

        Repeated Mentions of Risk Terms in Title & Description: +10 points

        Confidence Score Calculation (0-100%):
        90-100%:

        Clear high-risk terms (â‰¥2 high-risk terms) + Direct company/individual mention + Strongly negative sentiment

        70-89%:

        At least 1 high-risk term + Medium/low-risk terms + Negative sentiment but vague context

        50-69%:

        Only medium-risk terms OR weak sentiment analysis result

        Below 50%:

        No clear risk signals, ambiguous language, or neutral sentiment

        Required Input Fields from Article:
        Title: "title" (used for keyword detection)

        Description: "description" (used for keyword detection & sentiment)

        Content: "content" (used for deeper sentiment & risk term analysis)

        Published Date: "publishedAt" (for relevance assessment)

        Source: "source.name" (for credibility assessment)
        News Articles: __NEWS_DATA__
        Analyze all the news articles and provide a consolidated risk assessment in the following JSON format:

        Provide all the supporting articles link in the array, that are used to calculate the risk score. And which contains the risk terms.

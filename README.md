## üéØ Introduction

Financial crime risks, including **money laundering, tax fraud, and sanctions violations**, pose a **$2 trillion** global challenge. Current compliance processes rely on **manual risk assessments**, leading to **high operational costs, inefficiencies, and errors.**  

This **AI-driven solution** automates **entity research, verification, and risk scoring** by leveraging **Generative AI, NLP, and anomaly detection**. It cross-references multiple databases, **identifies fraudulent patterns, and provides real-time risk intelligence.**  

### **üåü Key Features:**  

‚úÖ **Automated Entity Extraction & Enrichment** from structured & unstructured transaction data  
‚úÖ **Real-time Sanctions & PEP Screening** (OFAC, UN, EU, FATF, OpenCorporates, Wikidata)  
‚úÖ **AI-Powered Anomaly Detection** to flag fraudulent entities & shell companies  
‚úÖ **Comprehensive Risk Scoring Framework** (Sanctions, Shell Companies, Tax Havens)  
‚úÖ **News Sentiment Analysis** for reputation-based risk assessment  
‚úÖ **Real-time API & Dashboard for Risk Monitoring**

  - When a **company name or registration number** is provided, we **query OpenCorporates** to retrieve detailed company information.  
  - Helps **identify shell companies & complex ownership structures**.  

2Ô∏è‚É£ **üîó OFAC Sanctions API**  
- **Purpose:** Checks if an entity is **sanctioned by the U.S. government**.  
- **How We Use It:**  
  - Queries **sanctions lists** for matches with **entity names, aliases, or tax IDs**.  
  - Flags entities **directly or indirectly linked to sanctioned individuals or businesses**.  

3Ô∏è‚É£ **üîó FATF API & Global Watchlists**  
- **Purpose:** Identifies entities listed in the **Financial Action Task Force (FATF) High-Risk Jurisdictions.**  
- **How We Use It:**  
  - Flags **businesses and individuals operating in high-risk countries**.  
  - Helps detect **money laundering and illicit financial activities**.  

4Ô∏è‚É£ **üîó SEC EDGAR API**
